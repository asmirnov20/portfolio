                About half a year ago, a close friend introduced me to programming. And after writing a few lines of code, I realized that this is what I want to do in the future. I set a goal for myself to become a front-end developer and I consistently moved towards this goal, every day devoting many hours to it and learning everything on my own. Iâ€™ve never needed any additional "motivation". On the contrary, I really love to constantly learn and improve my skills.
